## How To configuration
you must do sth else behind you fork this repo.

1. rename this repo rightly。

   if you wanna publish a github page，please rename this repo as "yourusername.github.io"，or you can create a branch named"gh-page".

2. CNAME file

  if you wanna bind a custom domain to the github page,you must create a file named"CNAME",and put your custom domain name into the file.
  
  but if you dont wanna--like me,you can delete this CNAME file.

3. modify the config.

   the website settings is almost in _config.yml.，modify it.(the comment will tell you how to)

   **config moudle:** do not modify the _config.yml's content what is about the comment.you can modify the _includes/comments.html file.we supported Gitalk.you can change it by your self--it is easy!
   
   
4. delete all my posts & images.
   
   folder "_posts",“_drafts”,"_wiki","images" are all my posts.

   * \_posts folder stores my posts.
   * \_drafts folder stores my drafts.
   * \_wiki folder stores my wiki.
   * images folder stores [@mzlogin][author]'s images.you know in china we cant read the photo in github.
   
5. 修改「关于」页面。

   pages/about.md is the ABOUT PAGE.the contents is all personal!please remove them and write sth about you.the folder /_data/skills.yml & /_data/social.yml stores your feature.


## Thinking

* please write the post as easily as you could.

* there is a proverb in china:"一图抵千言。" it means:"1 image can instead of 1000 words." so image is important.

* please write the useful post,do not write other thing.

* if you are writing the tech. blog,please get one's ideas into shape!!!!!!

* you can learn the [@mzlogin][mzblog]'s blog，you can learn about "how to write a clearer post?"
